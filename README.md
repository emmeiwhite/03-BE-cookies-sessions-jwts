# 🍪 1. The Origin of Cookies — Explained for Lifetime Retention

## 🔹 Background: Why do cookies exist?

HTTP is a **stateless** protocol.

Every time your browser sends a request to a server, the server doesn't know if it's you, your friend, or someone new. It doesn't remember you between requests.

## 🔹 Enter Cookies: Tiny pieces of data stored in the browser, sent with every request to the same domain.

They were originally invented for:

- Session management (e.g., "stay logged in")
- Personalization (e.g., dark mode)
- Tracking (e.g., analytics, ads)

🧠 A cookie is like a name tag. When the browser returns to the server, it says: `"Hey, I’m Imran – here's my tag!"`
